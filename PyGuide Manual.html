<h1>PyGuide: Image Analysis for Telescope Guiding</h1>

<p>PyGuide offers image analysis routines for telescope guiding, including a star finder, centroider and star shape fitter. The algorithms are designed to work well with partial images, e.g. where much of the image of a star is lost down a spectrograph slit or off the edge of a coherent fiber optic bundle.

<p><a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/rowen/PyGuide%20Manual.html">PyGuide</a> was written by Russell E. Owen, based on algorithms and code by Jim Gunn, and with help from Connie Rockosi and Craig Loomis. The current version may be downloaded <a href="ftp://ftp.astro.washington.edu/pub/users/rowen/python/PyGuide.zip">here</a>, and older versions <a href="ftp://ftp.astro.washington.edu/pub/users/rowen/python/">here</a> (ignore any files whose name begins with a period).

<h2><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements and Installation</h2>

<p>To install and use PyGuide you must have the following:

<ul>
	<li>Python 2.2.1 or later, built to use IEEE floating point. Warning: I have only tested PyGuide under python 2.4.
	<li>A C compiler that python distutils can use.
	<li>Numarray (1.1 or later recommended).
	<li>If you want findStars to display images in ds9 then ds9, xpa and RO.DS9 are required. ds9 and xpa are available from <a href="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/">http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/</a>. RO.DS9 is part of the RO package available from <a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/rowen/">http://www.astro.washington.edu/rowen/</a>. 
</ul>

<p>To install, use the standard python "distutils" procedure:<pre>
% python setup.py build
% sudo python setup.py install
</pre>

<p>(Note that this creates a file "ups/PyGuide.table". This is package information used by the Fermilab/Princeton UPS runtime loader. If you don't use that system then you can ignore it or delete it.)

<h2><a name="UsersGuide"></a>User's Guide</h2>

<p>The main routines are:
<ul>
	<li>PyGuide.findStars: find stars on an image.
	<li>PyGuide.centroid: find the centroid of a star given a reasonable initial guess.
	<li>PyGuide.starShape: fit a symmetrical double Gaussian to a star.
	<li>PyGuide.ImUtil: utility routines including skyStats, subFrameCtr and routines for converting between a few <a href="#CoordSys">coordinate systems</a>.
	<li>PyGuide.FakeData: routines to construct images with fairly realistic stars and noise (but no aberrations and no cosmic rays).
</ul>

<p>See <a href="#Masks">Masks</a> and <a href=#Coordinates">Coordinates</a> for some important information about using these routines. For details about a particular package or subroutine, get help in the usual way (or read the comments at the beginning of each routine):<pre>
>>> import PyGuide
>>> help(PyGuide.centroid)
>>> help(PyGuide)
</pre>

<p>Other files of interest (in the source distribution, not installed):
<ul>
	<li><a href="PyGuide%20Version%20History.html">PyGuide Version History.html</a>: version history
	<li>doFindStars.py: scan an image, display the image and some scan diagnostics in ds9 and report star centroids and shapes. Thus this is an example of how to use PyGuide and a very useful diagnostic tool.
	<li>test/...: code to check the various routines, plus test results.
	<li>checkPyGuide: runs pychecker on PyGuide (if pychecker is installed).
</ul>

<h3><a name="Masks"></a>Masks</h3>

<p>A mask is required for images that have missing light, e.g. due to light going down a slit on a slitviewer image, or truncated by the edge of a fiber bundle. The mask tells PyGuide what portions of the image to ignore.

<p>A mask consists of a boolean array (of type numarray.Bool) with the same dimensions as the image. A value of True masks out the corresponding pixel in the image, making PyGuide ignore that data.

<p><b>Warning:</b> to get good results, you must mask out all bad areas of the image, including transitional areas where the image is dimmer but not completely dark. Thus, for example, you should mask out the edges of a slit (where you can still see some light but some of it is lost). If you fail to mask out transitional data, you will get garbage out of the centroider.

<h3><a name="CentroidingHints"></a>Hints For Centroiding</h3>

<p>PyGuide.centroid is capable of doing a very good job of centroiding. However, it is also capable of returning garbage of you are not careful. To get good results:

<ul>
	<li>Specify realistic bias, read noise and ccd gain. In particular, if the bias is too large (e.g. larger than the background of the image), you'll get NaN for the centroid error estimate and nonsense for the centroid.

	<li>If you are centroiding a slit image or other partially obscured image:
	<ul>
		<li>Specify a good <a href=#Masks">mask</a>. It must be big enough to include the transitional area of the slit (where the light is partially dimmed).

		<li>Use a radius large enough to include the whole star. This is crucial with a slit viewer, because the star will usually be seen as two blobs (one on either side of the slit), and if the radius is too small, the centroider will jump to the center of one of those blobs.
	</ul>

	<li>Do not try to centroid on a star that has nearby bright neighbors. You must be especially careful of this if your star will be partially obscured, because the relative brightness of the neighbors increases as the main star's light is obscured.
</ul>

<h3><a name="Coordinates"></a>Coordinate Systems</h3>

<p>PyGuide uses x to mean the rows of a CCD (parallel to the shift register) and y the columns. Also, by default:
<ul>
	<li>The center of the lower-left corner pixel has xy position (0.5, 0.5), and thus:
	<li>The lower-left edge of the image has xy position (0,0)
	<li>The upper-right edge of an MxN image has xy position (M, N)
	<li>The center of an MxN image has xy position (M/2.0, N/2.0)
</ul>

<p>Another common convention is that used by iraf and ds9: the center of the lower left pixel is (1.0, 1.0) and the lower left corner of the image is (0.5, 0.5). PyGuide.ImUtil includes converters between ds9 position and xy position: ds9PosFromXYPos and xyPosFromDS9Pos. In addition, if you really dislike the zero-point convention for xy position, you can change it. The zero point is defined by PyGuide.Constants.PosMinusIndex. To modify PosMinusIndex, edit PyGuide/python/PyGuide/Constants.py and reinstall the software. PyGuide ships with PosMinusIndex = 0.5; to use the ds9 convention, change it to 1.0. (Note that ds9PosFromXYPos and xyPosFromDS9Pos work correctly regardless of how you set PosMinusIndex.)

<p>In addition to xy position, PyGuide internally makes use of ij position: rounding ij position to the nearest integer gives the array index of the pixel containing that position. The main reason for ij position is because numarray swaps indices (like the C language): the x axis is the second axis of a numarray array. Thus conversion between ij and xy position involves swapping axes and a small offset (PosMinusIndex).

<p>PyGuide.ImUtil offers routines to convert between ds9 position, xy position, ij position and ij index. If you are doing any array manipulation in your own code, you will probably find these very useful.

<h3><a name="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
	<li>PyGuide.centroid's error estimate tend to over-estimate the error (but not in a sufficiently predictable fashion to be trivially fixed). You can see my test results at PyGuide/tests/test results/testCentroidLong <i>date</i>.txt
	<li>PyGuide.centroid's measure of asymmetry is not well normalized, so it is unlikely to be useful outside of the centroider. This measure tends to get large for bright objects that are mostly masked off.
	<li>PyGuide.starShape assumes a symmetrical star, and so does not fit ellipticity.
	<li>PyGuide does not deal with dark current. As long as dark current is not a dominant source of noise this should be acceptable.
</ul>
