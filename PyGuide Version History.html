<h1>PyGuide Version History</h1>

<h2>1.3 prerelease 2005-04-25</h2>

<p>Incompatible changes:

<ul>
	<li>findStars returns the median of the unmasked data. This makes it practical to estimate signal to noise ratio for centroided stars. Warning: I will probably modify it to return std dev, as well.
	
	<li>findStars: added rad argument; if specified, it overrides radMult.

	<li>starShape now requires that you specify the radius of the data to explore.
</ul>

<p>Other changes:

<ul>
	<li>starShape now uses Jim Gunn's original weighting function. This seems to give somewhat better its and fewer surprising failures (at least for the test code). However, chiSq is no longer even remotely normalized.
</ul>

<h2>1.2.1 2005-03-31</h2>

<p>Improved doFindStars so that the mask can be specified as a file name and that parameters may be specified as keyword arguments (to easily override a default value).

<p>Minor tweaks:
<ul>
	<li>findStars ds9 display (if ds9 true): displays the smoothed masked data in frame 3 if verbosity >= 2. Otherwise does not set frame 3, for a more space-efficient display.
	<li>centroid: improved the debug output for where the walk is going. Slightly improved the efficiency of the test for "walked too far".
	<li>radProf.radAsymmWeighted: fixed two errors in the doc string regarding the arguments and tweaked the description of ijCtr and rad arguments in all doc strings.
</ul>

<p>Bug fix: findStars failed while trying to display star data if verbosity >= 2.

<h2>1.2 2005-02-08</h2>

<p>Modified the main routines (listed below) to use conventional xy position instead of ij array index-based position: the axes are swapped and the zero point is has changed (see the manual for more information). As a result, the following routines have modified arguments and the first two also have modified return data:
<ul>
	<li> findStars
	<li> centroid
	<li> starShape
	<li> FakeData.fakeStar
	<li> ImUtil.subFrameCtr
</ul>

<p>Added coordinate conversion routines to ImUtil to convert between ij position, xy position and ds9 position.

<h2>1.1.1 2005-01-31</h2>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>FakeData.py had __all__ == instead of __all__ =.
</ul>

<h2>1.1 2004-12-01</h2>

<p>Visible Changes:
<ul>
	<li>doFindStars:
	<ul>
		<li>Renamed function from starUtil to doFindStars to match module name.
		<li>Replaced arguments with globals to make it easier to change settings.
	</ul>
	<li>Constants: added NaN
	<li>StarShape: StarShapeData: made NaN the default for all arguments.
</ul>

Bug fixes:
- doFindStars: if starShape failed, crashed trying to set starData.

Internal Changes:
- Added __all__ to StarShape.py, ImUtil.py, FakeData.py


<h2>1.0 2004-10-22</h2>

<p>First public release.
