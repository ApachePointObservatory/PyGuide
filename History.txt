Changes:
- Modified centroid to have a minimum radius.

Bug fixes:
- doFindStars.py had not been updated for findStars 2004-08-06.
Note that it now needs bias, read noise and ccd gain information.

2004-08-06 v2

Changes:
- findStars and centroid require new inputs: bias, read noise and ccd gain.
- The centroid error estimate is much improved (though still not perfect)
and centroiding is somewhat improved. Warning: the new error estimate typically over-estimates the error.
See tests/test results/testCentroidLong... for data.

Bug fixes:
- ImUtils.getQuartile doc string described nonexistent argument "verbosity".

Bug fixes:
- case error in setup.py (thanks to Craig Loomis)
- FindStars.findStars doc string described nonexistent argument "rad" (thanks to Craig Loomis)
- added checkPyGuide, which runs pychecker on PyGuide.
- various bug fixes turned up by pychecker (most of which were only exposed by using the debug flags, but one of which was exposed by using ds9=True).
