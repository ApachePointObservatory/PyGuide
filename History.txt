Note:
- This version has been tested with numarray 1.1. Like all C extensions that use numarray
  you must rebuild PyGuide if you upgrade numarray from 0.9 or 1.0.

Changes:
- findStars: changed the default dataCut to 3.0 from 4.5.
- findStars no longer displays a 3rd frame in ds9 (formerly it was the smoothed image).
  The old code is commented out in case you still want it.
- doFindStars (not installed, but a handy test function) now reports star shape.
- Minor changes to includes in the C code and to setup.py. These changes make
  the code look more like the numarray 1.1 examples and may allow PyGuide
  to be installed even if numarray was not installed in the usual location.

Changes:
- Modified centroid to have a minimum radius.

Bug fixes:
- doFindStars.py had not been updated for findStars 2004-08-06.
Note that it now needs bias, read noise and ccd gain information.

2004-08-06 v2

Changes:
- findStars and centroid require new inputs: bias, read noise and ccd gain.
- The centroid error estimate is much improved (though still not perfect)
and centroiding is somewhat improved. Warning: the new error estimate typically over-estimates the error.
See tests/test results/testCentroidLong... for data.

Bug fixes:
- ImUtils.getQuartile doc string described nonexistent argument "verbosity".

2004-08-06

Bug fixes:
- case error in setup.py (thanks to Craig Loomis)
- FindStars.findStars doc string described nonexistent argument "rad" (thanks to Craig Loomis)
- added checkPyGuide, which runs pychecker on PyGuide.
- various bug fixes turned up by pychecker (most of which were only exposed by using the debug flags, but one of which was exposed by using ds9=True).
