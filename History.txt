1.2 2005-02-07

Modified the main routines (listed below) to use x,y position
instead of i,j array index-based position.
x,y position has the axes swapped and a zero point defined
by PyGuide.Constants.PosMinusIndex and thus can be adjusted.
By default PyGuide.Constants.PosMinusIndex=0.5, meaning:
* (0,0) is the lower edge of the image,
* (0.5, 0.5) is the center of the corner pixel.
* (M,N) is the upper edge of an MxN image.

As a result, the following routines have modified arguments
and the first two also have modified return data:
* findStars
* centroid
* starShape
* FakeData.fakeStar
* ImUtil.subFrameCtr

Added coordinate conversion routines to ImUtil to convert between
i,j position, x,y position and ds9 position.

1.1.1 2005-01-31

Bug fixes:
- FakeData.py had __all__ == instead of __all__ =.

1.1 2004-12-01

Visible Changes:
- doFindStars:
	- Renamed function from starUtil to doFindStars to match module name.
	- Replaced arguments with globals to make it easier to change settings.
- Constants: added NaN
- StarShape: StarShapeData: made NaN the default for all arguments.

Bug fixes:
- doFindStars: if starShape failed, crashed trying to set starData.

Internal Changes:
- Added __all__ to StarShape.py, ImUtil.py, FakeData.py
